Thanks for checking this out! This project is (slowly) implementing a Foundry system for SLA Industries 2ed by Nightfall games.
https://nightfall.games/sla-industries/

As this is a hobby project not affiliated with Nightfall games there are a few things to keep in mind:
- There are no compendium items with this system.  This avoids copyright issues.  If you'd like Items, Armor, Formulae etc. please purchase the core books from Nightfall.
- The item system supports entering the items from the core books and supplements.
- I'm working on this solo and as time permits which unfortunaely due to having to pay bills progress is limited. (I'm aiming to do a release quareterly)

This project is currently a BETA. What does that mean?
- Until the System is "feature complete" the version will not be increased to v1.0
- The data model may fluctuate and no migration scripts will be done until the system is more stable. 
  - This means you may need to re-enter character data and item data from time to time.
- What does feature complete mean??!
    - All sheets are done Character and Threats
    - Dice roll cards are implemented to "pretty up" the results, make the success vs. skill dice more clear and have damage buttons etc on the cards.
    - I will NOT be implementing "Roll Rsolution" i.e. there will be no automatic calculation of roll vs. DV
    - Ammunition counters and reload buttons for weapons
    - Melee dice reservation for defense
    - Movment provider for drag ruler built into the system
    - Implementing a wound tracker
    - Adding effects to items (deathsuit bonuses etc when equipped)
    - Implementing "target logic" i.e. Apply damage directly to targeted token.
- Post 1.0 
  - Look and feel improvements (i.e. Non-disruptive changes)
    - Improve the look of sheets and UI to closer match the books
    - Overall CSS improvements
    - Dice so Nice Soupport
